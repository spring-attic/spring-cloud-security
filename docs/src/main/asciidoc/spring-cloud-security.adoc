=== Single Sign On

An app will activate `@EnableOAuth2Sso` if you bind provide the
following properties in the `Environment`:

* `spring.oauth2.client.\*` with `*` equal to `clientId`, `clientSecret`,
  `accessTokenUri`, `userAuthorizationUri` and one of:
+
  ** `spring.oauth2.resource.userInfoUri` to use the "/me" resource
  (e.g. "https://uaa.run.pivotal.io/userinfo" on PWS), or
+
  ** `spring.oauth2.resource.tokenInfoUri` to use the token decoding endpoint
  (e.g. "https://uaa.run.pivotal.io/check_token" on PWS).
+
If you specify both the `userInfoUri` and the `tokenInfoUri` then 
you can set a flag to say that one is preferred over the other 
(`preferTokenInfo=true` is the default). Or

* `spring.oauth2.resource.jwt.keyValue` to
  decode a JWT token locally, where the key is a verification key. The
  verification key value is either a symmetric secret or PEM-encoded
  RSA public key. If you don't have the key and it's public you can
  provide a URI where it can be downloaded (as a JSON object with a
  "value" field) with `spring.oauth2.resource.jwt.keyUri`. E.g. on PWS:
+ 
----
$ curl https://uaa.run.pivotal.io/token_key
{"alg":"SHA256withRSA","value":"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBI...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"}
----

WARNING: If you use the `spring.oauth2.resource.jwt.keyUri` the authorization
server needs to be running when your application starts up. It will
log a warning if it can't find the key, and tell you what to do to fix
it.

You can set the preferred scope (as a comma-separated list or YAML
array) in `spring.oauth2.client.scope`. It defaults to empty, in which case
most Authorization Servers will ask the user for approval for the
maximum allowed scope for the client.

There is also a setting for `spring.oauth2.client.clientAuthenticationScheme` which
defaults to "header" (but you might need to set it to "form" if, like
Github for instance, your OAuth2 provider doesn't like header
authentication). The `spring.oauth2.client.*` properties are bound to an instance 
of `AuthorizationCodeResourceDetails` so all its properties can be specified.

=== Token Type in User Info

Google (and certain other 3rd party identity providers) is more strict
about the token type name that is sent in the headers to the user info
endpoint. The default is "Bearer" which suits most providers and
matches the spec, but if you need to change it you can set
`spring.oauth2.resource.tokenType`.

=== Customizing the RestTemplate

The SSO (and Resource Server) features use an `OAuth2RestTemplate`
internally to fetch user details for authentication. This is provided
as a qualified `@Bean` with id "userInfoRestTemplate", but you
shouldn't need to know that to just use it. The default should be fine
for most providers, but occasionally you might need to add additional
interceptors, or change the request authenticator (which is how the
token gets attached to outgoing requests). To add a customization just
create a bean of type `UserInfoRestTemplateCustomizer` - it has a
single method that will be called after the bean is created but before
it is initialized. The rest template that is being customized here is
_only_ used internally to carry out authentication (in the SSO or
Resource Server use cases).

A second {@link OAuth2RestTemplate} is available for autowiring if you
want to use it for back channel calls, and if there is a
token-authenticated user (in a web application) it will have the token
injected for you.

[TIP]
====
To set an RSA key value in YAML use the "pipe" continuation
marker to split it over multiple lines ("|") and remember to indent
the key value (it's a standard YAML language feature). Example:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
        oauth2:
          resource:
            jwt:
              keyValue: |
                -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
                MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKC...
                -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
----

==== Access Decision Rules

By default the whole application will be secured with OAuth2 with the
same access rule ("authenticated"). This includes the Actuator
endpoints, which you might prefer to be secured differently, so Spring
Cloud Security provides a configurer callback that lets you change the
matching and access rules for OAuth2 authentication. Any bean of type
`OAuth2SsoConfigurer` (there is a convenient empty base class) will
get 2 callbacks, one to set the request matchers for the OAuth2
filter, and one with the full `HttpSecurity` builder (so you can set
up all sorts of behaviour, but the main application is to control
access rules).

The default login path, i.e. the one that triggers the redirect to the
OAuth2 Authorization Server, is "/login". It will always be added to
the matching patterns for the OAuth2 SSO, even if you have
`OAuth2SsoConfigurer` beans as well. The default logout path is
"/logout" and it gets similar treatment, as does the "home" page
(which is the logout success page, defaults to "/"). Those paths can
be overriden by setting `spring.oauth2.sso.*' (`loginPath`, `logoutPath` and
`home.path`).

For example if you want the resources under "/ui/**" to be protected with OAuth2:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableOAuth2Sso
	@EnableAutoConfiguration
	protected static class TestConfiguration extends OAuth2SsoConfigurerAdapter {
		@Override
		public void match(RequestMatchers matchers) {
			matchers.antMatchers("/ui/**");
		}
	}
----

In this case the rest of the application will default to the normal
Spring Boot access control (Basic authentication, or whatever custom
filters you put in place).

==== Integrating with the Actuator Endpoints

The Spring Boot Actuator endpoints ("/env", "/metrics", etc.) if
present will, by default, be protected by the standard Spring Boot
basic authentication. The SSO authentication filter is added in a
position directly behind the filter that intercepts requests to the
Actuator endpoints by default (i.e.
`ManagementProperties.BASIC_AUTH_ORDER + 1` which is
`Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE-9` or `2147483636`). If you want to change
the order you can set `spring.oauth2.sso.filterOrder`. If you do that
and the value is less than the default, then you will need to consider
setting the access rules for the Actuator, since they will become
accessible to all authenticated users who sign on with the external
provider. One way to do that would be to set
`management.contextPath=/admin` (for instance) and use an
`OAuth2SsoConfigurer` to set the access rules, e.g.

```java
	@Configuration
	@EnableOAuth2Sso
	@EnableAutoConfiguration
	protected static class TestConfiguration extends OAuth2SsoConfigurerAdapter {
		@Override
		public void configure(HttpSecurity http) {
	         http.authorizeRequests()
                 .antMatchers("/admin/**").role("ADMIN")
                 .anyRequest().authenticated();
		}
	}
```

=== Resource Server

The `@EnableOAuth2Resource` annotation will protect your API endpoints
if you have the same environment settings as the SSO client, except
that it doesn't need a `tokenUri` or `authorizationUri`, and it also
doesn't need a `clientId` and `clientSecret` if it isn't using the
`tokenInfoUri` (i.e. if it has `jwt.*` or `userInfoUri`).

By default *all* your endpoints are protected (i.e. "+/**+") but you can 
pick and choose by adding a `ResourceServerConfigurerAdapter` (standard
Spring OAuth feature), e.g. to protect only the "/api/**" resources

.Application.java
[source,java]
----
@RestController
@EnableOAuth2Resource
class Application extends ResourceServerConfigurerAdapter {

  @Override
  public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.requestMatchers()
      .antMatchers("/api/**")
   .and()
     .authorizeRequests()
       .anyRequest().authenticated();
  }
  
  @RequestMapping("/api")
  public String home() {
    return "Hello World";
  }

}
----

==== Customizing the JWT Token Converter

When a resource server accepts an access token as a JWT, it has to
convert it to an `Authentication` so that Spring Security can do its
access decisions. Different token providers might support JWT tokens
with different contents, so Spring OAuth2 has an abstraction for
converting the token into security domain objects
(`AccessTokenConverter`). You can modify the default behaviour easily
by providing a `@Bean` of type `JwtAccessTokenConverterConfigurer`,
e.g.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Component
	public class JwtCustomization extends DefaultAccessTokenConverter implements
			JwtAccessTokenConverterConfigurer {

		@Override
		public void configure(JwtAccessTokenConverter converter) {
			converter.setAccessTokenConverter(this);
		}

        ... // implement custom AccessTokenConverter here

	}

----

=== Token Relay

A Token Relay is where an OAuth2 consumer acts as a Client and
forwards the incoming token to outgoing resource requests. The
consumer can be a pure Client (like an SSO application) or a Resource
Server.

==== Client Token Relay

If your app has a
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud.html#netflix-zuul-reverse-proxy[Spring
Cloud Zuul] embedded reverse proxy (using `@EnableZuulProxy`) then you
can ask it to forward OAuth2 access tokens downstream to the services
it is proxying. Thus the SSO app above can be enhanced simply like this:

.app.groovy
[source,java]
----
@Controller
@EnableOAuth2Sso
@EnableZuulProxy
class Application {
  
}
----

and it will (in addition to loggin the user in and grabbing a token)
pass the authentication token downstream to the `/proxy/*`
services. If those services are implemented with
`@EnableOAuth2Resource` then they will get a valid token in the
correct header.

How does it work? The `@EnableOAuth2Sso` annotation pulls in
`spring-cloud-starter-security` (which you could do manually in a
traditional app), and that in turn triggers some autoconfiguration for
a `ZuulFilter`, which itself is activated because Zuul is on the
classpath (via `@EnableZuulProxy`). The
{githubmaster}/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/security/oauth2/proxy/OAuth2TokenRelayFilter.java[filter]
just extracts an access token from the currently authenticated user,
and puts it in a request header for the downstream requests.

==== Resource Server Token Relay

If your app has `@EnableOAuth2Resource` and also is a Client (i.e. it
has a `spring.oauth2.client.clientId`, even if it doesn't use it),
then the `OAuth2RestOperations` that is provided for `@Autowired`
users by Spring Cloud (it is declared as `@Primary`) will also forward
tokens. If you don't want to forward tokens (and that is a valid
choice, since you might want to act as yourself, rather than the
client that sent you the token), then you only need to create your own
`OAuth2RestOperations` instead of autowiring the default one. Here's
a basic example showing the use of the autowired rest template ("foo.com"
is a Resource Server accepting the same tokens as the surrounding app):

.MyController.java
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private OAuth2RestOperations restTemplate;
    
@RequestMapping("/relay")
public String relay() {
    ResponseEntity<String> response = 
      restTemplate.getForEntity("https://foo.com/bar", String.class);
    return "Success! (" + response.getBody() + ")";
}
----

== Configuring Authentication Downstream of a Zuul Proxy

You can control the authorization behaviour downstream of an
`@EnableZuulProxy` through the `proxy.auth.*` settings. Example:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
proxy:
  auth:
    routes:
      customers: oauth2
      stores: passthru
      recommendations: none
----

In this example the "customers" service gets an OAuth2 token relay,
the "stores" service gets a passthrough (the authorization header is
just passed downstream), and the "recommendations" service has its
authorization header removed. The default behaviour is to do a token
relay if there is a token available, and passthru otherwise.

See
{githubmaster}/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/security/oauth2/proxy/ProxyAuthenticationProperties[
ProxyAuthenticationProperties] for full details.
