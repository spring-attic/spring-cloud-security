== More Detail

=== Single Sign On

NOTE: All of the OAuth2 SSO and resource server features moved to Spring Boot
in version 1.3. You can find documentation in the
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Boot user guide].

=== Token Relay

A Token Relay is where an OAuth2 consumer acts as a Client and
forwards the incoming token to outgoing resource requests. The
consumer can be a pure Client (like an SSO application) or a Resource
Server.

==== Client Token Relay in Spring Cloud Gateway

If your app also has a
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/current/single/spring-cloud.html#_spring_cloud_gateway[Spring
Cloud Gateway] embedded reverse proxy then you
can ask it to forward OAuth2 access tokens downstream to the services
it is proxying. Thus the SSO app above can be enhanced simply like
this:

.App.java
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory filterFactory;

@Bean
public RouteLocator customRouteLocator(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
    return builder.routes()
            .route("resource", r -> r.path("/resource")
                    .filters(f -> f.filter(filterFactory.apply()))
                    .uri("http://localhost:9000"))
            .build();
}
----

or this

.application.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: resource
        uri: http://localhost:9000
        predicates:
        - Path=/resource
        filters:
        - TokenRelay=
----

and it will (in addition to logging the user in and grabbing a token)
pass the authentication token downstream to the services (in this case
`/resource`).

To enable this for Spring Cloud Gateway add the following dependencies

- `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client`
- `org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-security`

How does it work?  The
{githubmaster}/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/security/oauth2/gateway/TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory.java[filter]
extracts an access token from the currently authenticated user,
and puts it in a request header for the downstream requests.

For a full working sample see https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/sample-gateway-oauth2login[this project].

==== Client Token Relay

If your app is a user facing OAuth2 client (i.e. has declared
`@EnableOAuth2Sso` or `@EnableOAuth2Client`) then it has an
`OAuth2ClientContext` in request scope from Spring Boot. You can
create your own `OAuth2RestTemplate` from this context and an
autowired `OAuth2ProtectedResourceDetails`, and then the context will
always forward the access token downstream, also refreshing the access
token automatically if it expires. (These are features of Spring
Security and Spring Boot.)

NOTE: Spring Boot (1.4.1) does not create an
`OAuth2ProtectedResourceDetails` automatically if you are using
`client_credentials` tokens. In that case you need to create your own
`ClientCredentialsResourceDetails` and configure it with
`@ConfigurationProperties("security.oauth2.client")`.


==== Client Token Relay in Zuul Proxy

If your app also has a
http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud.html#netflix-zuul-reverse-proxy[Spring
Cloud Zuul] embedded reverse proxy (using `@EnableZuulProxy`) then you
can ask it to forward OAuth2 access tokens downstream to the services
it is proxying. Thus the SSO app above can be enhanced simply like
this:

.app.groovy
[source,java]
----
@Controller
@EnableOAuth2Sso
@EnableZuulProxy
class Application {

}
----

and it will (in addition to logging the user in and grabbing a token)
pass the authentication token downstream to the `/proxy/*`
services. If those services are implemented with
`@EnableResourceServer` then they will get a valid token in the
correct header.

How does it work? The `@EnableOAuth2Sso` annotation pulls in
`spring-cloud-starter-security` (which you could do manually in a
traditional app), and that in turn triggers some autoconfiguration for
a `ZuulFilter`, which itself is activated because Zuul is on the
classpath (via `@EnableZuulProxy`). The
{githubmaster}/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/security/oauth2/proxy/OAuth2TokenRelayFilter.java[filter]
just extracts an access token from the currently authenticated user,
and puts it in a request header for the downstream requests.

==== Resource Server Token Relay

If your app has `@EnableResourceServer` you might want to relay the
incoming token downstream to other services. If you use a
`RestTemplate` to contact the downstream services then this is just a
matter of how to create the template with the right context.

If your service uses `UserInfoTokenServices` to authenticate incoming
tokens (i.e. it is using the `security.oauth2.user-info-uri`
configuration), then you can simply create an `OAuth2RestTemplate`
using an autowired `OAuth2ClientContext` (it will be populated by the
authentication process before it hits the backend code). Equivalently
(with Spring Boot 1.4), you could inject a
`UserInfoRestTemplateFactory` and grab its `OAuth2RestTemplate` in
your configuration. For example:

.MyConfiguration.java
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public OAuth2RestTemplate restTemplate(UserInfoRestTemplateFactory factory) {
    return factory.getUserInfoRestTemplate();
}
----

This rest template will then have the same `OAuth2ClientContext`
(request-scoped) that is used by the authentication filter, so you can
use it to send requests with the same access token.

If your app is not using `UserInfoTokenServices` but is still a client
(i.e. it declares `@EnableOAuth2Client` or `@EnableOAuth2Sso`), then
with Spring Security Cloud any `OAuth2RestOperations` that the user
creates from an `@Autowired` `@OAuth2Context` will also forward
tokens. This feature is implemented by default as an MVC handler
interceptor, so it only works in Spring MVC. If you are not using MVC
you could use a custom filter or AOP interceptor wrapping an
`AccessTokenContextRelay` to provide the same feature.

Here's a basic
example showing the use of an autowired rest template created
elsewhere ("foo.com" is a Resource Server accepting the same tokens as
the surrounding app):

.MyController.java
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private OAuth2RestOperations restTemplate;

@RequestMapping("/relay")
public String relay() {
    ResponseEntity<String> response =
      restTemplate.getForEntity("https://foo.com/bar", String.class);
    return "Success! (" + response.getBody() + ")";
}
----

If you don't want to forward tokens (and that is a valid
choice, since you might want to act as yourself, rather than the
client that sent you the token), then you only need to create your own
`OAuth2Context` instead of autowiring the default one.

Feign clients will also pick up an interceptor that uses the
`OAuth2ClientContext` if it is available, so they should also do a
token relay anywhere where a `RestTemplate` would.

== Configuring Authentication Downstream of a Zuul Proxy

You can control the authorization behaviour downstream of an
`@EnableZuulProxy` through the `proxy.auth.*` settings. Example:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
proxy:
  auth:
    routes:
      customers: oauth2
      stores: passthru
      recommendations: none
----

In this example the "customers" service gets an OAuth2 token relay,
the "stores" service gets a passthrough (the authorization header is
just passed downstream), and the "recommendations" service has its
authorization header removed. The default behaviour is to do a token
relay if there is a token available, and passthru otherwise.

{githubmaster}/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/security/oauth2/proxy/ProxyAuthenticationProperties[
ProxyAuthenticationProperties] for full details.
